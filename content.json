Here is Ciceroâ€™s personal technology blog, and it is honour for me to share my development experience, programming skills and some of my life feelings in this blog. I am a EEE student who aspire to become a skilled Integrated Circuit Designer in the future, and in this blog I will share with you the knowledge about Verilog syntax, SoC design and some other things about digital system design; besides, I am also interested in Machine Learning applications, and now I am striving to studying the related courses about this area like CS229. In the not-too-distant future, I will upload some of interesting open-source projects on my Github, and if you want to have a communication with me, you can comment at the bottom of each article or send me email to: &#107;&#97;&#x69;&#107;&#117;&#x6f;&#49;&#x39;&#57;&#x38;&#x40;&#104;&#x6f;&#x74;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;.
